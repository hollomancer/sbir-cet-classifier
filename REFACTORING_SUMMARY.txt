🎯 REFACTORING PRIORITIES (4 weeks)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WEEK 1: Low-Risk, High-Impact                                    [2.5-3.5 days]
  ✓ Storage layer consolidation         500 → 150 lines (-70%)
  ✓ CLI reorganization                   Better structure
  ✓ Test fixture consolidation           -50% duplication
  
WEEK 2: Configuration & Scoring                                   [4-5 days]
  ✓ Configuration unification            3 systems → 1
  ✓ Scoring system consolidation         Clear API
  
WEEK 3: Enrichment & Dependencies                                 [4-5 days]
  ✓ Enrichment service unification       5 modules → 1
  ✓ Dependency injection pattern         Better testing
  ✓ Error handling standardization       Consistent behavior
  
WEEK 4: Polish                                                    [3 days]
  ✓ Model standardization                All Pydantic
  ✓ Documentation improvements           Google-style docstrings

💡 TOP 3 REFACTORINGS BY IMPACT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  
  1. CONFIGURATION CONSOLIDATION
     Before: 3 separate systems, duplicated path logic
     After:  Unified ConfigurationManager, single cache
     Impact: Simplifies 200 lines to 100 lines
     Risk:   Medium (touches many modules)
     
  2. STORAGE SIMPLIFICATION  
     Before: 8 writer/reader classes, 500 lines
     After:  Generic ParquetStorage[T], 150 lines
     Impact: 70% code reduction, type-safe operations
     Risk:   Low (well-tested)
     
  3. SCORING UNIFICATION
     Before: 4 separate scoring implementations
     After:  CETScorer with strategy pattern
     Impact: Clear API, easy mode switching
     Risk:   Medium (behavioral changes)

📚 DOCUMENTATION CREATED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🚀 GETTING STARTED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  
  1. Read REFACTORING_OPPORTUNITIES.md for analysis
  2. Review REFACTORING_EXAMPLES.md for code patterns  
  3. Follow docs/REFACTORING_QUICK_START.md week-by-week
  4. Track progress with success metrics
  5. Maintain 100% test pass rate throughout
  
✅ KEY SUCCESS FACTORS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  • Incremental changes (one refactoring at a time)
  • Test-first approach (verify before & after)
  • Feature branches (easy rollback)
  • Code review all changes
  • Update docs alongside code
  • Keep 232/232 tests passing
