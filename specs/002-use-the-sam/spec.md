# Feature Specification: SAM.gov API Data Enrichment

**Feature Branch**: `002-use-the-sam`  
**Created**: 2025-10-10  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "use the sam.gov API to enrich and further classify our data with Awardee Historical Data, Agency Program Office Details, Related Opportunities, Solicitation Text & Requirements, and Award Modifications & Amendments."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Enhanced Award Analysis (Priority: P1)

Researchers analyzing SBIR awards can access comprehensive awardee background information to better understand award patterns and success factors. When viewing an award, they see the awardee's historical performance, previous awards, and track record.

**Why this priority**: Core value proposition - transforms basic award data into actionable intelligence for portfolio analysis and due diligence.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by querying any existing award and verifying enriched awardee data appears, delivering immediate analytical value.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a researcher views an SBIR award, **When** they access the award details, **Then** they see awardee historical data including previous awards, success rates, and performance metrics
2. **Given** an award with an established awardee, **When** the system enriches the data, **Then** it displays the awardee's track record across multiple agencies and programs

---

### User Story 2 - Program Context Discovery (Priority: P2)

Analysts can understand the broader program context of awards by accessing detailed agency program office information and related opportunities. This helps identify strategic focus areas and program relationships.

**Why this priority**: Enables strategic analysis by connecting individual awards to broader program initiatives and agency priorities.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by examining any award and verifying program office details and related opportunities are displayed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an analyst reviews an award, **When** they examine program details, **Then** they see agency program office information, contact details, and strategic focus areas
2. **Given** an award from a specific program, **When** viewing related opportunities, **Then** they see other solicitations and awards from the same program office

### User Story 3 - Comprehensive Award Lifecycle Tracking (Priority: P3)

Portfolio managers can track the complete lifecycle of awards including modifications, amendments, and changes over time. This provides visibility into award evolution and performance adjustments.

**Why this priority**: Supports advanced portfolio management by showing how awards evolve, but not critical for basic enrichment value.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by examining awards with known modifications and verifying amendment history is captured.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an award with modifications, **When** viewing the award timeline, **Then** all amendments and changes are displayed chronologically
2. **Given** a portfolio manager tracking award performance, **When** they review award modifications, **Then** they can see funding changes, scope adjustments, and timeline extensions

### User Story 4 - Enhanced Classification via Solicitation Analysis (Priority: P2)

The CET classification system can leverage detailed solicitation text and requirements to improve classification accuracy by understanding the original intent and technical requirements of awards.

**Why this priority**: Directly improves the core classification capability by providing richer context for ML models.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by comparing classification accuracy before and after solicitation text enrichment.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an award with available solicitation text, **When** the system performs CET classification, **Then** it incorporates solicitation requirements to improve accuracy
2. **Given** solicitation text containing specific technical requirements, **When** classifying against CET categories, **Then** the system identifies relevant technology areas mentioned in the original solicitation

### Edge Cases

- What happens when SAM.gov API is unavailable or returns errors?
- How does the system handle awards with no corresponding SAM.gov data?
- What occurs when API rate limits are exceeded during bulk enrichment?
- How are data inconsistencies between existing awards and SAM.gov data resolved?
- What happens when awardee information has changed since the original award?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST integrate with SAM.gov API to retrieve awardee historical data for existing awards
- **FR-002**: System MUST fetch and store agency program office details including contact information and strategic focus areas
- **FR-003**: System MUST identify and retrieve related opportunities based on program office, topic areas, and solicitation relationships
- **FR-004**: System MUST extract and store complete solicitation text and technical requirements for classification enhancement
- **FR-005**: System MUST track and store award modifications, amendments, and lifecycle changes
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle API authentication and rate limiting according to SAM.gov terms of service
- **FR-007**: System MUST validate and reconcile data between existing awards and SAM.gov sources
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide enrichment status tracking showing which awards have been successfully enriched
- **FR-009**: System MUST incorporate enriched solicitation data into the existing CET classification pipeline
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle partial enrichment scenarios where only some data types are available

### Key Entities

- **Enriched Award**: Extended award record containing original data plus SAM.gov enrichments
- **Awardee Profile**: Historical performance data, previous awards, success metrics, and organizational details
- **Program Office**: Agency program details, contacts, strategic priorities, and related solicitations
- **Solicitation**: Complete solicitation text, technical requirements, evaluation criteria, and topic classifications
- **Award Modification**: Amendment records, funding changes, scope adjustments, and timeline modifications
- **Enrichment Status**: Tracking record showing completion status and data quality for each enrichment type

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Successfully enrich 95% of existing awards with at least one data type from SAM.gov API
- **SC-002**: Retrieve complete awardee historical data for 90% of awards with identifiable awardees
- **SC-003**: Improve CET classification accuracy by 10% through incorporation of solicitation text analysis
- **SC-004**: Complete bulk enrichment of existing 997 sample awards within 30 minutes
- **SC-005**: Maintain enrichment pipeline performance of processing 100 awards per minute during normal operations
- **SC-006**: Achieve 99% data consistency between enriched records and source SAM.gov data
- **SC-007**: Reduce manual research time for award analysis by 60% through comprehensive enrichment data

## Assumptions

- SAM.gov API provides stable access with documented rate limits and authentication requirements
- Existing award data contains sufficient identifiers (award numbers, awardee names) to match with SAM.gov records
- Solicitation text and requirements are available in machine-readable format through the API
- Historical awardee data extends back far enough to provide meaningful context for existing awards
- Agency program office information is current and maintained in SAM.gov systems
- Award modifications and amendments are comprehensively tracked in SAM.gov database

## Dependencies

- SAM.gov API access and authentication credentials
- Existing SBIR award dataset with valid award identifiers
- Current CET classification pipeline for integration of enriched data
- Data storage capacity for additional enrichment data (estimated 5-10x current data volume)

## Out of Scope

- Real-time synchronization with SAM.gov (batch processing approach)
- Historical reconstruction of awards not present in SAM.gov
- Integration with other government databases beyond SAM.gov
- Manual data entry or correction of SAM.gov inconsistencies
- Custom solicitation parsing beyond what SAM.gov API provides
