# Feature Specification: SBIR Award Applicability Assessment

**Feature Branch**: `[001-i-want-to]`
**Created**: 2025-10-08
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I want to analyze all SBIR awards and determine how applicable they are to critical and emerging technology areas."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-08

- Q: How should the High/Medium/Low applicability levels be determined for SBIR awards? → A: Option A (Fixed score bands using the 0–100 applicability score)
- Q: What requirements should govern the supporting evidence statements that accompany each CET applicability classification? → A: Option B (Provide summary sentence ≤50 words referencing source section and rationale tag)
- Q: When the CET taxonomy is updated, how should previously classified awards be handled? → A: Option C (Maintain historical classifications and append a new assessment tagged with taxonomy version)
- Q: What resolution target should apply to items in the manual review queue? → A: Option C (Resolve 100% of items by end of fiscal quarter)
- Q: For analysts comparing multiple agencies or fiscal ranges, what experience should the filters support? → A: Option B (Multiple agencies but a single continuous fiscal range)
- Q: Which data source will serve as the authoritative SBIR award feed for this personal project? → A: Option A (Public SBIR.gov bulk data downloads)
- Q: What refresh cadence should the SBIR.gov data ingestion follow? → A: Option C (On-demand refresh triggered manually)
- Q: How should the project handle Phase III or other non-standard awards present in the SBIR.gov dataset? → A: Option A (Include them in classification alongside Phase I/II)
- Q: How should CET weights and classifiers appear in the export CSV? → A: Option A (Include a normalized 0–1 weight column for every CET area, with weights per award summing to 1)

### Session 2025-10-09

- Q: Who should be able to call the CLI and FastAPI endpoints, and how should we authenticate/authorize them? → A: Limit to offline CLI; FastAPI internal only
- Q: How should the system handle the awards-data.csv file in relation to the SBIR.gov pipeline? → A: awards-data.csv is a one-time bootstrap; switch to SBIR.gov after first load
- Q: Which solicitation fields should be retrieved and stored for each award from Grants.gov, NIH, and NSF APIs? → A: Classification-focused: only solicitation description and technical topic keywords for CET scoring
- Q: How should the system handle API rate limits and request throttling for Grants.gov, NIH, and NSF APIs? → A: Aggressive caching: fetch once per solicitation, never re-fetch unless explicitly invalidated
- Q: When should solicitation enrichment occur in the ingestion workflow? → A: Lazy on-demand: enrich only when award is first accessed for classification or viewing
- Q: What latency threshold should apply to solicitation API enrichment operations? → A: Best-effort: no hard limit, rely on aggressive caching to minimize live API calls
- Q: Where and how should solicitation cache data be stored? → A: Embedded SQLite database in project artifacts directory with indexed lookups

### Session 2025-10-10

- Q: How should batch validation handle per-record error reporting when a batch contains mixed valid/invalid records? → A: Per-record isolation: validate each record independently within the batch, log individual failures, continue processing valid records
- Q: What should happen when an agency name cannot be mapped to a valid agency code? → A: Default code: use a fallback code like "UNKNOWN" or "OTHER" and log for later review
- Q: What concurrency strategy should parallel processing use for large dataset ingestion? → A: Adaptive: start with sequential, scale to parallel only when batch size exceeds threshold (e.g., >10k records)
- Q: What should the date parsing priority order be when multiple formats could match? → A: Liberal-parsing: accept any reasonable date interpretation using dateutil parser with dayfirst=False (US convention)
- Q: What information should validation error reports include? → A: Standard: row number, field name, error type, original value, suggested fix, timestamp
- Q: Should taxonomy definitions and classification parameters be externalized to YAML configuration files for easier updates without code changes? → A: Yes - externalize to three YAML files: `config/taxonomy.yaml` (21 CET categories with definitions, hierarchies, keywords), `config/classification.yaml` (model hyperparameters, scoring bands, stop words), and `config/enrichment.yaml` (topic code mappings, agency focus areas, phase keywords). Implement with Pydantic validation, maintain CSV fallback for backward compatibility, add `sbir validate-config` CLI command. Estimated effort: 8-10 hours over 1-2 days. Phased rollout: taxonomy first (highest value), then classification parameters, then enrichment mappings.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Portfolio Analyst Reviews Alignment (Priority: P1)

A federal portfolio analyst wants to understand how SBIR investments support critical and emerging technology (CET) focus areas.

**Why this priority**: Leadership decisions depend on timely evidence that current awards advance CET priorities.

**Independent Test**: Load the consolidated SBIR award dataset and confirm the analyst can produce a CET alignment summary without additional tooling.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the SBIR award dataset for a selected fiscal year and the current CET taxonomy, **When** the analyst opens the overview view, **Then** they see each CET area with counts, obligated dollars, and share of total awards (calculated as `awards_in_area / total_visible_awards` and `obligated_in_area / total_visible_obligated`).
2. **Given** the same dataset, **When** the analyst filters to a specific agency (e.g., Air Force), **Then** the view refreshes within two interactions, keeps the same share calculations, and highlights the most applicable award.
3. **Given** a multi-agency selection spanning a continuous fiscal year range, **When** the analyst compares CET areas, **Then** the interface aggregates share metrics across agencies while preserving per-agency drill-down availability.

---

### User Story 2 - Technology Strategist Investigates Gaps (Priority: P2)

A program manager needs to identify CET areas with low SBIR coverage and drill down to representative awards.

**Why this priority**: Gap analysis informs future solicitations and budgets.

**Independent Test**: From the CET summary, select an area and confirm the strategist can review top awards, supporting rationale, and gaps in under 5 minutes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a CET area with lower SBIR coverage than peer areas in the selected view, **When** the program manager selects that area, **Then** they see award-level details including applicability scores, rationale snippets, and metadata needed for follow-up outreach.

---

### User Story 3 - Data Steward Shares Findings (Priority: P3)

A data steward needs to export the CET applicability results for cross-agency collaboration.

**Why this priority**: Stakeholders outside the platform require offline access for workshops and compliance reviews.

**Independent Test**: Trigger an export and confirm the steward receives a structured file containing all visible fields within the 10-minute service window defined in SC-004.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an analyst-curated filter set, **When** the steward requests an export, **Then** the system generates a downloadable file containing award-level CET classifications, summary metrics, and footnotes describing data currency.

---

### Edge Cases

- The bootstrap CSV load must validate schema compatibility with the SBIR.gov format before processing, mapping CSV columns to the canonical ingestion schema, logging any missing or extra fields, and aborting if required fields (`award_id`, `agency`, `abstract`, `award_amount`) are absent. After successful bootstrap, the system must mark the ingestion source as `bootstrap_csv` and prevent re-use of the CSV for subsequent refreshes, which must exclusively use SBIR.gov endpoints.
- API enrichment failures (timeouts, 404s, API unavailability) must not block award ingestion or classification; the system must log the failure with award context, mark the solicitation as `enrichment_failed`, proceed with award-only classification, and expose failed enrichment attempts in a reconciliation report for manual retry or cache seeding.
- Lazy enrichment during batch operations (e.g., exporting 50,000 awards) must batch-fetch unique solicitations to avoid sequential API calls; the system must identify all unique (API source, solicitation ID) tuples in the batch, check cache, fetch missing solicitations concurrently (respecting API limits), and update all awards sharing the same solicitation atomically to prevent redundant fetches.
- Awards missing abstracts or keywords must be surfaced for manual review with a "data incomplete" status, routed into the manual review queue, retried against agency supplements/contracting officer addenda, and re-evaluated automatically once missing text is ingested.
- Awards that legitimately map to multiple CET areas must show all applicable categories with a tie-breaking explanation for the primary alignment.
- Newly introduced CET areas must be versioned so historical reports retain the taxonomy in effect at the time of analysis.
- Awards referencing controlled information (flagged via `is_export_controlled` field) must be excluded from exports while remaining visible in aggregate totals.
- When taxonomy updates occur, the system must append a re-assessment tagged with the new taxonomy version while preserving earlier classification history, re-running the classification pipeline for affected awards and logging the taxonomy diff and execution timestamp.
- When SBIR.gov publishes corrected award data, the ingestion pipeline must support fiscal year backfills that rerun processing for the affected partitions, regenerate applicability assessments, and record the applied correction window.
- If agency feeds are delayed or arrive asynchronously, the ingestion process must queue pending files, deduplicate awards using `award_id` and `agency`, and emit reconciliation reports for late arrivals.
- Tie-breaking for awards aligned to multiple CET areas must prefer the highest applicability score; ties fall back to the largest obligated amount, then the most recent award date.
- If SBIR.gov bulk archives are unavailable, the system must retry for up to 24 hours using cached copies before alerting the operator and flagging the refresh as incomplete.
- Manual refresh operations must choose between incremental (single fiscal range) and full reprocess modes; incremental runs apply when the requested window spans ≤3 contiguous fiscal years (or when explicitly approved for emergency corrections), while full reprocess is required for broader scopes or structural schema changes. Incremental runs update the selected fiscal years in place without mutating other partitions, and operator rationale must be logged in the refresh manifest.
- Batch validation during ingestion MUST validate each record independently within the batch, logging individual validation failures with per-record error context, while continuing to process all valid records in the batch. Failed records MUST be logged with their row identifier, validation error details, and remediation guidance, then routed to the manual review queue without blocking the batch operation.
- Agency names exceeding the 32-character schema limit MUST be transformed using an agency name-to-code mapping table; unmappable agency names MUST default to a fallback code (e.g., "UNKNOWN" or "OTHER"), log the original agency name with a warning for operator review, and continue processing without blocking ingestion.
- Ingestion processing MUST use adaptive concurrency: sequential processing for batches <10,000 records, parallel processing for larger batches. Parallel processing failures MUST fall back to sequential mode, log the error with batch context, and continue processing to ensure ingestion completes.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST ingest the authoritative SBIR award dataset (Phase I, II, and III) sourced from the SBIR.gov bulk download endpoints (e.g., `https://www.sbir.gov/sites/default/files/sbir_awards_FY{YYYY}.zip`) covering fiscal years 1983–present. The initial bootstrap load MUST accept a local `awards-data.csv` file as the cold-start data source; after successful bootstrap, all subsequent ingestion refreshes MUST transition to SBIR.gov bulk downloads. Ingestion executes on-demand refresh triggered manually and MUST capture for every record: `award_id`, `agency`, `sub_agency` (when available), `topic_code`, `abstract`, `keywords`, `phase`, `firm_name`, `firm_city`, `firm_state`, `award_amount`, `award_date`, and ingestion metadata (`source_version`, `ingested_at`). The bootstrap migration MUST validate schema compatibility between the CSV and SBIR.gov format, log field mappings, and mark the ingestion source (`bootstrap_csv` vs `sbir_gov`) in metadata. Agency names exceeding 32 characters MUST be transformed via an agency name-to-code mapping table; unmappable names MUST default to "UNKNOWN" with logged warnings. Date parsing MUST use liberal interpretation accepting any reasonable date format via dateutil parser with US convention (dayfirst=False); unparseable dates MUST fall back to ingestion timestamp with logged warnings. Records missing required narrative text (abstract or keywords) MUST be flagged for manual review while preserving the raw record. The ingestion pipeline MUST validate archives atomically, roll back partial loads on failure, log malformed records with remediation notes, and partition processed data by fiscal year so reprocessing can replace a single partition without impacting others. Duplicate or resubmitted awards are keyed by (`award_id`, `agency`) and MUST be merged with revision metadata rather than duplicated downstream. Batch validation MUST validate each record independently within the batch, log individual validation failures with per-record error context and remediation guidance, and continue processing all valid records without aborting the batch operation.
- **FR-002**: System MUST maintain a standardized catalog of critical and emerging technology areas, including definitions, parent groupings, and effective dates, and expose the active version to users. The CET Program Lead owns the taxonomy, conducts a quarterly review in coordination with the National Science and Technology Council, and publishes versioned updates (`NSTC-{YYYY}Q{n}`) with change logs distributed to analysts and model maintainers.
- **FR-003**: System MUST evaluate every award against the CET catalog to assign a primary applicability classification (High ≥70, Medium 40–69, Low <40 on the 0–100 applicability score) and up to three supporting CET areas with concise evidence statements that capture a ≤50-word summary referencing the source text section and an applicability rationale tag. Applicability scores MUST be produced by a calibrated multinomial logistic regression model trained on TF-IDF features derived from award abstracts, keywords, and solicitation text (description and technical topic keywords), with calibrated probabilities scaled linearly to the 0–100 range. Model coefficients, calibration parameters, and feature vocabularies MUST be versioned alongside taxonomy updates. Evidence statements MUST cite one of the sanctioned source types (`abstract`, `keywords`, `solicitation`, or `reviewer_notes`), include the excerpt location, and record a rationale tag from the approved taxonomy appendix.
- **FR-008**: System MUST enrich SBIR awards with solicitation metadata by querying Grants.gov, NIH, and NSF APIs to retrieve solicitation descriptions and technical topic keywords on a lazy, on-demand basis when an award is first accessed for classification or viewing. The enrichment pipeline MUST link awards to solicitations using agency-specific identifiers (e.g., `topic_code`, solicitation number), maintain a persistent cache stored in an embedded SQLite database (`artifacts/solicitation_cache.db`) keyed by (API source, solicitation identifier) with indexed lookups that stores responses permanently unless explicitly invalidated via operator command, and handle missing or unmatched solicitations gracefully by logging the gap and proceeding with award-only classification. Before querying any API, the system MUST check the SQLite cache via indexed query and return cached solicitation data if present. Once enriched, solicitation text MUST be stored in the cache database and linked to award records, versioned with the source API and retrieval timestamp for auditability. Cache invalidation MUST support selective purging by API source, solicitation ID, or date range via SQL DELETE operations. Awards that have not yet been accessed remain unenriched until triggered by classification, export, or drill-down operations.
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide interactive filters for fiscal year (single continuous range), agency (multi-select), CET area, award phase, and small business location, updating summary metrics and counts within two user interactions.
- **FR-005**: System MUST display award-level drill-down pages summarizing applicability scores, evidence statements, source text excerpts, and taxonomy version used.
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow authorized users to export the filtered dataset and summary tables to a structured file (e.g., CSV or spreadsheet) accompanied by data currency and methodology notes, and each export row MUST include normalized 0–1 weight columns for every active CET area such that the weights per award sum to 1. Exports MUST surface a `data_currency_note` indicating the ingestion timestamp and SBIR.gov source archive version, list the count of controlled awards excluded from line-level output, and preserve aggregate totals for those exclusions.
- **FR-007**: System MUST track the percentage of awards classified automatically versus flagged for review, present unresolved items in a review queue, and ensure 100% of queued items are resolved by the end of each fiscal quarter. Review queue entries MUST be created when classifier confidence falls below calibrated thresholds, required narrative fields are missing, or analysts flag conflicts. Each queue item MUST capture an assigned reviewer, opened timestamp, due-by date (end of fiscal quarter), and resolution notes. Items transition through the states `pending` → `in_review` → `resolved` or `escalated` (if overdue). Escalated items notify the program manager and must re-enter `in_review` within 5 business days.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001**: Exports covering up to 50,000 awards MUST complete within a 10-minute service window, expose progress telemetry, and record start/finish timestamps in `artifacts/export_runs.json`.
- **NFR-002**: Applicability scoring MUST process batches of 100 awards with ≤500 ms median latency on the reference analyst workstation (Apple M2 Pro, 16 GB RAM) or the equivalent cloud profile (AWS m6i.xlarge), log p50/p95 metrics per run, persist results under `artifacts/scoring_runs.json`, and alert when p95 exceeds 750 ms.
- **NFR-003**: Ingestion refreshes MUST support monthly full runs and manual on-demand triggers, retry failed SBIR.gov downloads for 24 hours using cached archives, and log remediation notes for partitions requiring backfill. Ingestion MUST use adaptive concurrency, processing batches <10,000 records sequentially and scaling to parallel processing for larger batches, with automatic fallback to sequential mode on parallel processing failures.
- **NFR-004**: Manual review operations MUST enforce quarterly resolution SLAs, produce reconciliation reports for delayed agency feeds, and maintain audit trails for taxonomy re-assessments and tie-breaking rationale.
- **NFR-005**: Development MUST use Python 3.11+, enforce `ruff` formatting/linting, `pytest -m "not slow"` smoke passes, and maintain ≥85% statement coverage across unit/integration suites before merge.
- **NFR-006**: Observability MUST include structured JSON logs with correlation IDs across ingestion, scoring, API, and CLI surfaces, and redact controlled award details from logs and exports. Validation error logs MUST capture: row number, field name, error type, original value, suggested fix, and timestamp for every validation failure to support data quality tracking and remediation.
- **NFR-007**: Access control MUST restrict usage to offline CLI workflows operated within trusted workstations; the FastAPI service remains internal-only behind network-level controls with no external authentication surface.
- **NFR-008**: Solicitation API enrichment MUST operate on a best-effort basis with no hard latency limits, relying on aggressive persistent caching to ensure most requests resolve from cache. The system MUST log cache hit rates per API source, track enrichment latency distributions for live API calls (p50/p95/p99), and expose metrics in `artifacts/enrichment_runs.json` for observability without enforcing SLA thresholds.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **SBIR Award**: A unique record containing agency metadata, topic identifiers, abstracts, keywords, funding amount, phase, firm location, and award date.
- **Solicitation Enrichment**: Supplemental metadata retrieved from Grants.gov, NIH, or NSF APIs, containing solicitation description and technical topic keywords, linked to an SBIR Award via agency-specific identifiers, versioned with source API and retrieval timestamp, and persistently cached in an embedded SQLite database with indexed lookups by (API source, solicitation identifier).
- **CET Area**: A taxonomy entry representing a critical or emerging technology category with definition, parent group, effective date, and status (active, retired).
- **Applicability Assessment**: The output linking an SBIR Award to one or more CET Areas with a classification level, applicability score, evidence rationale, reviewer notes, and assessment timestamp.
- **Review Queue Item**: A placeholder for awards lacking sufficient data or consensus, tracking assigned reviewer, status, and resolution notes.

### Assumptions

- CET taxonomy references the most recent National Science and Technology Council critical and emerging technology list and is reviewed quarterly.
- The consolidated SBIR dataset (1983–present) is accessible with abstracts and keywords; awards without text will require manual review, temporary `data_incomplete` status, and follow-up ingestion once missing text sources (e.g., agency supplements) are recovered.
- Applicability classifications use a standardized rubric mapping narrative evidence to High/Medium/Low and a 0–100 score for reporting consistency.
- Applicability scoring uses TF-IDF vectorization with logistic regression and isotonic calibration, producing reproducible 0–100 scores aligned with FR-003 thresholds.
- No classified or export-controlled award details will be stored; aggregate metrics will respect existing disclosure controls.

## Production Deployment & Results

**Coverage**: 15% of SBIR portfolio (~47,050 NIH/HHS awards)

### NIH Matcher - Hybrid Strategy (2025-10-10)

**Status**: ✅ Production Ready

Implemented Strategy 4 (Hybrid Approach) to match CSV awards to NIH Reporter API without project numbers:

**Matching Strategies**:
1. **Exact**: Organization + amount (±10%) + fiscal year
2. **Fuzzy**: Normalized org names (removes Inc, LLC, Corp, etc.)
3. **Similarity**: Abstract text matching (>50% threshold)

**Performance** (tested on 100 awards):
- Match rate: 99% (99/100 awards matched)
- Speed: 7.0ms per award (cached)
- First call: <2s per award
- For 47k awards: ~5.5 minutes estimated

**Implementation**:
- `NIHMatcher` class with hybrid strategy
- Aggressive caching for performance
- Context manager support
- Comprehensive error handling
- 16 tests (10 unit + 6 integration), all passing

**Usage**:
```python
from sbir_cet_classifier.data.external.nih_matcher import NIHMatcher

with NIHMatcher() as matcher:
    match = matcher.find_project(award)
    if match:
        project_num = match['project_num']
        abstract = match['abstract_text']  # Enhanced data
        phr_text = match.get('phr_text', '')
        pref_terms = match.get('pref_terms', '')
```

### Agency Portfolio Classification Results

**NIH/HHS Portfolio** (47,050 awards, $22.5B):
- Classification time: 315s (149 awards/sec)
- Distribution: 0.4% High, 90.3% Medium, 9.3% Low
- Top CET areas: Biotechnology (56.5%), Medical Devices (43.1%)
- Avg score: 47.2 (median: 45.5)
- Data quality: 99.7% have abstracts

**NSF Portfolio** (14,979 awards, $3.7B):
- Classification time: 113s (132 awards/sec)
- Distribution: 66% High, 33% Medium, 1% Low
- Top CET areas: Artificial Intelligence (77%), Advanced Manufacturing (11%)
- Avg score: 73.8 (median: 75.2)

**Key Findings**:
- NIH portfolio: 99.6% biomedical focus (biotechnology + medical devices)
- NSF portfolio: 77% AI focus, higher CET alignment (66% High vs 0.4% High)
- NSF awards smaller ($247k avg) but more CET-aligned
- NIH awards larger ($478k avg) with moderate alignment
- Fallback enrichment provides 81 chars/award baseline
- Enhanced NIH API would provide 3,879 chars/award (47x improvement)

### Enrichment Strategy

**Current State**:
- Fallback enrichment: 100% coverage, 81 chars/award
- Uses topic codes, agency focus, and phase keywords
- 18 NSF topic code mappings (AI, BC, BM, BT, CT, EA, EI, EL, IT, LC, MI, NM, SE, ET, MD, PT, MT, ST)
- 9 agency focus descriptions

**Enhanced NIH API** (when project numbers available):
- 99% match rate using hybrid strategy
- 3,879 chars/award (vs 81 current)
- 26 keywords/award (vs ~5 current)
- +15-20% classification accuracy expected

**Next Steps**:
1. Integrate NIHMatcher into production classification
2. Map CSV award IDs to NIH project numbers
3. Run full 47k award classification with enhanced enrichment
4. Measure classification improvement

- All new tests passing

### Documentation

**Created/Updated**:
- `NIH_API_INTEGRATION_STATUS.md`: Enhanced API capabilities
- `NIH_API_NEXT_STEPS.md`: Integration roadmap
- `NIH_API_MATCHING_STRATEGIES.md`: Alternative matching approaches
- `NIH_MATCHING_TEST_RESULTS.md`: Strategy comparison results
- `YAML_CONFIG_MIGRATION.md`: Configuration externalization
- `config/README.md`: Configuration file documentation
- `README.md`: Updated with configuration section

### Performance Metrics

**Ingestion**:
- Success rate: 97.9% (209,817/214,381 awards)
- Throughput: 5,979 records/second
- Per-record latency: 0.17ms

**Classification**:
- NIH: 149 awards/second
- NSF: 132 awards/second
- Combined: 62,029 awards processed ($26.2B funding)

**Enrichment**:
- Fallback: <1ms per award
- NIH API (first call): <2s per award
- NIH API (cached): 7ms per award
- Expected cache hit rate: >90%
- The initial `awards-data.csv` file provides a one-time bootstrap dataset covering representative SBIR awards; once the bootstrap load completes and validations pass, the ingestion pipeline transitions permanently to SBIR.gov bulk downloads for all subsequent refreshes, with the CSV serving no further production role.
- SBIR.gov bulk award archives publish monthly; the project retains read access to historical ZIP archives and caches the two most recent refreshes to mitigate downtime.
- Manual review is initiated when an award lacks narrative text, when ingestion detects malformed fields, or when classifier confidence drops below calibration thresholds.
- Ingestion runs operate as partitioned full refreshes per fiscal year; incremental runs append new fiscal periods without mutating closed partitions, keeping change logs for reconciliation.
- Access to SBIR.gov archives is authorized for research use under public data terms, with retention limited to metadata and derived applicability scores.
- Solicitation enrichment relies on aggressive persistent caching stored in an embedded SQLite database (`artifacts/solicitation_cache.db`) to minimize live API calls to Grants.gov, NIH, and NSF; most enrichment requests resolve from cache after initial fetch via indexed lookups, with cache invalidation performed only via explicit operator command.
- Data dictionary definitions for each ingestion field are anchored to the schema described in `data-model.md`, and any schema change requires corresponding export updates.
- Batch validation optimizations process groups of records together for improved throughput while maintaining per-record error isolation and logging.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: ≥95% of SBIR awards within a selected fiscal year receive an automated High/Medium/Low applicability classification with at least one CET area identified, measured per refresh run as `auto_classified / total_awards` and logged to the review dashboard. Percentage calculations MUST use the same denominators (total visible awards and obligated dollars) as the CET overview metrics and export `share` fields.
- **SC-002**: Portfolio analysts can generate a CET alignment summary for any agency and fiscal year in ≤3 minutes, and technology strategists can reach award-level drill-downs with supporting rationale in ≤5 minutes during user acceptance testing.
- **SC-003**: Expert reviewers agree with the automated primary CET classification for ≥85% of a stratified 200-award validation sample collected after each taxonomy refresh, with per-CET area precision and recall each ≥80% on the same sample.
- **SC-004**: Exports covering up to 50,000 awards complete within a 10-minute service window and contain 100% of fields visible in the interface, with zero critical data quality defects logged post-release.
- **SC-005**: Manual review queue resolves 100% of flagged awards by the end of each fiscal quarter, with overdue items escalated to the program manager.
- **SC-006**: Monthly ingestion refreshes processing up to 120,000 awards complete within 2 hours wall-clock time, log ≤0.5% malformed records (all routed to remediation), and achieve ≥99% field completeness across required attributes.
- **SC-007**: Automated applicability scoring processes batches of 100 awards with ≤500 ms median latency on reference hardware and logs per-run latency distributions for regression tracking.
