# Tasks: SBIR Award Applicability Assessment

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-i-want-to/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Establish project scaffolding, dependency management, and tooling required for implementation.

- [X] T001 [Shared] Create Python package skeleton (`src/sbir_cet_classifier/{data,features,models,evaluation,common,cli,api}`) plus mirrored `tests/{unit,integration,contract}/sbir_cet_classifier` directories.
- [X] T002 [Shared] Extend `pyproject.toml` with runtime deps (pandas, scikit-learn, spacy, pydantic, typer, fastapi, uvicorn) and dev extras (ruff, pytest, coverage).
- [X] T003 [P][Shared] Configure `ruff`, `pytest.ini`, and pre-commit hooks to enforce linting, formatting, and type-checking before PRs.

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core data ingestion, taxonomy, scoring, storage, and interface scaffolding required by all user stories.  
**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete.

- [X] T010 [Shared] Implement configuration module (`src/sbir_cet_classifier/common/config.py`) with environment-driven paths for `data/raw/`, `data/processed/`, and `artifacts/`.
- [X] T011 [Shared] Define Pydantic domain schemas (`src/sbir_cet_classifier/common/schemas.py`) covering SBIR awards, CET areas, applicability assessments, evidence statements, and review queue items.
- [X] T012 [P][Shared] Build SBIR.gov ingestion pipeline (`src/sbir_cet_classifier/data/ingest.py`) that downloads/unzips bulk files, normalizes records, and persists raw snapshots; include fixture-driven unit tests in `tests/unit/sbir_cet_classifier/data/test_ingest.py`.
- [X] T013 [P][Shared] Implement CET taxonomy loader (`src/sbir_cet_classifier/data/taxonomy.py`) supporting versioned definitions and immutability guarantees; cover with unit tests.
- [X] T014 [P][Shared] Create Parquet writer/reader utilities (`src/sbir_cet_classifier/data/store.py`) to materialize processed tables with partitioning by fiscal year.
- [X] T015 [Shared] Develop applicability scoring pipeline (`src/sbir_cet_classifier/models/applicability.py`) using TF-IDF + calibrated classifier, returning score, classification band, and supporting CET candidates.
- [X] T016 [P][Shared] Implement evidence extraction helpers using spaCy (`src/sbir_cet_classifier/features/evidence.py`) enforcing ‚â§50-word summaries and rationale tagging.
- [X] T017 [Shared] Create manual review repository (`src/sbir_cet_classifier/features/review_queue.py`) with SLA tracking and escalation logic tied to fiscal quarter boundaries.
- [X] T018 [P][Shared] Scaffold Typer CLI entry (`src/sbir_cet_classifier/cli/app.py`) with commands for refresh, summary, awards, review-queue, and exports (stubs call underlying services).
- [X] T019 [P][Shared] Scaffold FastAPI application (`src/sbir_cet_classifier/api/router.py`) aligning to `contracts/openapi.yaml` structure and sharing service layer with CLI.
- [X] T020 [Shared] Add unit/integration smoke tests covering schema validation, ingestion-store round trip, and CLI bootstrapping (`tests/integration/sbir_cet_classifier/test_bootstrap.py`).
- [X] T021 [Shared] Implement classification coverage metrics module (`src/sbir_cet_classifier/models/applicability_metrics.py`) that logs automated vs. manual rates and writes `artifacts/coverage.json` during refresh.
- [X] T022 [P][Shared] Build taxonomy re-assessment runner that detects new CET versions, reclassifies affected awards, and writes taxonomy diff + execution manifests to `artifacts/taxonomy_updates/`.
- [X] T023 [Shared] Add fiscal-year backfill workflow to ingestion pipeline, reprocessing targeted partitions, regenerating applicability assessments, and recording correction windows in refresh logs (`artifacts/backfill_runs.json`).
- [X] T024 [Shared] Implement delayed-feed queue handling that stores pending agency files, deduplicates by (`award_id`, `agency`), and emits reconciliation reports/alerts for late arrivals under `artifacts/delayed_feed_reports/`.
- [X] T025 [Shared] Extend refresh command with archive retry + cache fallback (24-hour window) and flag incomplete runs via operator alerts and `artifacts/archive_retry_logs.json` when SBIR.gov archives remain unavailable.
- [X] T026 [Shared] Support incremental vs. full refresh modes in CLI/API (guarding partition updates), persist mode selection plus scope metadata in refresh manifests, and record operator rationale in `artifacts/refresh_mode_audit.json`.
- [X] T027 [Shared] Instrument refresh runs to capture start/end timestamps, wall-clock duration, malformed-record ratio, and completeness metrics, persisting the report to `artifacts/refresh_runs.json` for SC-006/NFR-003.

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready‚Äîservices, CLI, and API skeletons operational with tests.
