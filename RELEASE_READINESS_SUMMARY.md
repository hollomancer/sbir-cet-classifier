## Schema Enhancements Completed

### 1. Award Schema - Optional Fields Added

**File**: `src/sbir_cet_classifier/common/schemas.py`

```python
class Award(BaseModel):
    # ... existing required fields ...
    program: str | None = None              # NEW - Optional SBIR program identifier
    solicitation_id: str | None = None      # NEW - Optional solicitation reference
    solicitation_year: int | None = None    # NEW - Optional solicitation year
```

**Rationale**: Support enrichment pipeline metadata while maintaining backward compatibility with bootstrap CSV ingestion.

### 2. Bootstrap Loader - Default Values

**File**: `src/sbir_cet_classifier/data/bootstrap.py`

**Changes**:
- `firm_name`: Defaults to "UNKNOWN" if missing
- `firm_city`: Defaults to "Unknown" if missing  
- `firm_state`: Defaults to "XX" (placeholder 2-char code) if missing
- `award_date`: Defaults to ingestion timestamp date if missing
- `topic_code`: Defaults to "UNKNOWN" if missing
- `phase`: Defaults to "Other" if missing or invalid

**Rationale**: Ensure robust handling of incomplete CSV data while maintaining Award schema compliance.

### 3. Grants.gov API - Description Parsing Fix

**File**: `src/sbir_cet_classifier/data/external/grants_gov.py:206-214`

**Change**: Combine synopsis and description fields when both present

```python
synopsis = opp.get("synopsis", "").strip()
desc_field = opp.get("description", "").strip()

if synopsis and desc_field:
    description = f"{synopsis}. {desc_field}"  # Combine both
else:
    description = synopsis or desc_field        # Use whichever available
```

**Rationale**: Maximize information extraction from Grants.gov API responses for enrichment quality.

### 4. Test Dataset - Agency Name Compliance

**File**: `award_data-3.csv`

**Change**: Replaced full agency names with standard abbreviations to comply with 32-character limit:
- "National Aeronautics and Space Administration" → "NASA"
- "Department of Health and Human Services" → "HHS"
- "Department of Homeland Security" → "DHS"
- And 7 other agencies

**Rationale**: Ensure test data complies with `agency: str = Field(max_length=32)` constraint.

## Performance SLA Targets (Not Yet Measured)

From spec.md Success Criteria:

| SLA | Target | Status | Notes |
|-----|--------|--------|-------|
| SC-001 | ≥95% classification coverage | ⏳ Pending | Requires production run |
| SC-002 | ≤3 min summary generation | ⏳ Pending | Requires timing instrumentation |

## Known Limitations & Next Steps

### Test Execution Note

- **pytest import conflict**: Running full test suite (`pytest tests/`) encounters module name collision between `tests/unit/.../test_bootstrap.py` and `tests/integration/.../test_bootstrap.py`. Tests pass when run by directory.
- **Workaround**: Run test suites separately: `pytest tests/unit`, `pytest tests/integration`, `pytest tests/contract`

### Artifacts Generated

✅ `artifacts/solicitation_cache.db` (24KB) - SQLite cache created during enrichment tests

### Pending Implementation

1. **CLI Entry Points**: Add to `pyproject.toml`:
   ```toml
   [project.scripts]
   sbir-cet = "sbir_cet_classifier.cli.app:main"
   ```

2. **Bootstrap CLI Command**: Add command to load award_data-3.csv:
   ```bash
   sbir-cet bootstrap --csv-path award_data-3.csv
   ```

3. **Telemetry Instrumentation**: Execute pipeline to generate JSON telemetry artifacts

4. **Performance Benchmarking**: Run on realistic dataset (1000+ awards) to validate SLAs

5. **Reviewer Agreement Study**: Coordinate manual validation of 200-award stratified sample

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Pre-Release)

1. ✅ **Execute end-to-end pipeline** with award_data-3.csv to generate telemetry artifacts
2. ✅ **Add CLI entry points** to pyproject.toml for production deployment
3. ✅ **Performance profiling** on larger dataset (5k-10k awards) to validate SC-002, SC-004, SC-006, SC-007
4. ✅ **Document CLI usage** in quickstart guide

### Short-Term (Post Phase 1)

5. ⚠️ **Reviewer agreement study** with domain experts (SC-003 validation)
6. ⚠️ **Production API staging** for enrichment success rate measurement (SC-005)
7. ⚠️ **Load testing** with 50k award dataset to validate export SLA (SC-004)

### Medium-Term (Phase 2+)

8. 📋 **Constitution re-evaluation** per plan.md governance requirements
9. 📋 **Taxonomy version 2** integration and diff logging
10. 📋 **Review queue UI** (currently CLI-only per plan summary)
