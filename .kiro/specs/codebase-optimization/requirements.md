# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines requirements for optimizing, refactoring, simplifying, and streamlining the SBIR CET Classifier codebase. The system currently exhibits several areas of technical debt, complexity, and redundancy that impact maintainability, performance, and developer experience. The optimization effort aims to create a cleaner, more efficient, and more maintainable codebase while preserving all existing functionality.
