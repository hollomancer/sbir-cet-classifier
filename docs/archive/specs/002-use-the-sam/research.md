# Research: SAM.gov API Integration

**Feature**: SAM.gov API Data Enrichment  
**Phase**: 0 - Research & Technical Decisions  
**Date**: 2025-10-10

## Research Tasks

### 1. SAM.gov API Authentication & Access

**Decision**: Use SAM.gov API v2 with API key authentication  
**Rationale**: 
- SAM.gov provides RESTful API v2 with comprehensive award data access
- API key authentication is simpler than OAuth for batch processing
- Rate limits are documented and manageable for our use case (100 awards/minute target)

**Alternatives considered**:
- Web scraping: Rejected due to terms of service violations and reliability issues
- SAM.gov bulk data downloads: Rejected due to lack of real-time updates and processing complexity
- FPDS-NG API: Considered but SAM.gov provides more comprehensive enrichment data

### 2. Data Matching Strategy

**Decision**: Multi-tier matching using award number, awardee DUNS/UEI, and fuzzy name matching  
**Rationale**:
- Award numbers provide exact matches when available
- DUNS/UEI identifiers ensure accurate awardee matching
- Fuzzy name matching handles variations in organization names
- Confidence scoring allows handling of uncertain matches

**Alternatives considered**:
- Award number only: Insufficient coverage due to missing/inconsistent award numbers
- Name matching only: Too error-prone for automated processing
- Manual matching: Doesn't scale to 200k+ awards

### 3. Rate Limiting & API Client Design

**Decision**: Implement exponential backoff with circuit breaker pattern  
**Rationale**:
- SAM.gov API has rate limits that must be respected
- Circuit breaker prevents cascading failures during API outages
- Exponential backoff handles temporary rate limit violations gracefully
- Batch processing allows for retry strategies

**Alternatives considered**:
- Simple rate limiting: Insufficient for handling API errors and outages
- Synchronous processing: Too slow for bulk enrichment requirements
- No error handling: Unacceptable for production reliability

### 4. Data Storage Schema Extension

**Decision**: Extend existing Parquet schema with enrichment tables  
**Rationale**:
- Maintains consistency with existing data architecture
- Parquet provides efficient storage and query performance
- Separate tables allow independent enrichment of different data types
- Preserves existing award data integrity

**Alternatives considered**:
- JSON storage: Less efficient for analytical queries
- Database storage: Adds complexity and infrastructure requirements
- In-memory only: Doesn't persist enrichment results

### 5. Integration with CET Classification Pipeline

**Decision**: Extend existing TF-IDF vectorization to include solicitation text  
**Rationale**:
- Leverages existing ML pipeline architecture
- Solicitation text provides rich technical context for classification
- Incremental approach minimizes risk to existing classification accuracy
- Allows A/B testing of classification improvements

**Alternatives considered**:
- Separate classification model: Adds complexity and maintenance overhead
- Replace existing pipeline: Too risky for production system
- Manual classification enhancement: Doesn't scale

## Technical Specifications

### API Client Requirements
- HTTP client with connection pooling (requests-based)
- Configurable timeout and retry policies
- Request/response logging for debugging
- API key management and rotation support

### Data Validation Requirements
- Schema validation for all SAM.gov API responses
- Data consistency checks between existing and enriched data
- Confidence scoring for fuzzy matches
- Error tracking and reporting for failed enrichments

### Performance Requirements
- Target: 100 awards/minute processing rate
- Bulk enrichment: Complete 997 awards within 30 minutes
- Memory usage: <2GB for batch processing
- Storage growth: 5-10x existing data volume acceptable

## Risk Mitigation

### API Availability Risk
- Implement circuit breaker to handle API outages
- Cache successful responses to avoid re-processing
- Graceful degradation when enrichment data unavailable

### Data Quality Risk
- Validate all API responses against expected schemas
- Implement confidence scoring for uncertain matches
- Provide manual review interface for low-confidence matches

### Performance Risk
- Implement parallel processing with configurable concurrency
- Monitor API response times and adjust rate limiting
- Provide progress tracking for long-running enrichment jobs

## Next Steps

Phase 1 deliverables based on research findings:
1. **data-model.md**: Define enriched data schemas and relationships
2. **contracts/**: SAM.gov API integration contracts and response schemas
3. **quickstart.md**: Developer guide for enrichment pipeline setup and usage
