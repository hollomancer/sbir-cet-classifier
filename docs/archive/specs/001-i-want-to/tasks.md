# Tasks: SBIR Award Applicability Assessment

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-i-want-to/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Establish project scaffolding, dependency management, and tooling required for implementation.

- [X] T002 [Shared] Extend `pyproject.toml` with runtime deps (pandas, scikit-learn, spacy, pydantic, typer, fastapi, uvicorn) and dev extras (ruff, pytest, coverage).
- [X] T003 [P][Shared] Configure `ruff`, `pytest.ini`, and pre-commit hooks to enforce linting, formatting, and type-checking before PRs.

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core data ingestion, taxonomy, scoring, storage, and interface scaffolding required by all user stories.  
**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete.

- [X] T010 [Shared] Implement configuration module (`src/sbir_cet_classifier/common/config.py`) with environment-driven paths for `data/raw/`, `data/processed/`, and `artifacts/`.
- [X] T011 [Shared] Define Pydantic domain schemas (`src/sbir_cet_classifier/common/schemas.py`) covering SBIR awards, CET areas, applicability assessments, evidence statements, and review queue items.
- [X] T012 [P][Shared] Build SBIR.gov ingestion pipeline (`src/sbir_cet_classifier/data/ingest.py`) that downloads/unzips bulk files, normalizes records, and persists raw snapshots; include fixture-driven unit tests in `tests/unit/sbir_cet_classifier/data/test_ingest.py`.
- [X] T013 [P][Shared] Implement CET taxonomy loader (`src/sbir_cet_classifier/data/taxonomy.py`) supporting versioned definitions and immutability guarantees; cover with unit tests.
- [X] T014 [P][Shared] Create Parquet writer/reader utilities (`src/sbir_cet_classifier/data/store.py`) to materialize processed tables with partitioning by fiscal year.
- [X] T015 [Shared] Develop applicability scoring pipeline (`src/sbir_cet_classifier/models/applicability.py`) using TF-IDF + calibrated classifier, returning score, classification band, and supporting CET candidates.
- [X] T016 [P][Shared] Implement evidence extraction helpers using spaCy (`src/sbir_cet_classifier/features/evidence.py`) enforcing ‚â§50-word summaries and rationale tagging.
- [X] T017 [Shared] Create manual review repository (`src/sbir_cet_classifier/features/review_queue.py`) with SLA tracking and escalation logic tied to fiscal quarter boundaries.
- [X] T018 [P][Shared] Scaffold Typer CLI entry (`src/sbir_cet_classifier/cli/app.py`) with commands for refresh, summary, awards, review-queue, and exports (stubs call underlying services).
- [X] T019 [P][Shared] Scaffold FastAPI application (`src/sbir_cet_classifier/api/router.py`) aligning to `contracts/openapi.yaml` structure and sharing service layer with CLI.
- [X] T020 [Shared] Add unit/integration smoke tests covering schema validation, ingestion-store round trip, and CLI bootstrapping (`tests/integration/sbir_cet_classifier/test_bootstrap.py`).
- [X] T021 [Shared] Implement classification coverage metrics module (`src/sbir_cet_classifier/models/applicability_metrics.py`) that logs automated vs. manual rates and writes `artifacts/coverage.json` during refresh.
- [X] T022 [P][Shared] Build taxonomy re-assessment runner that detects new CET versions, reclassifies affected awards, and writes taxonomy diff + execution manifests to `artifacts/taxonomy_updates/`.
- [X] T023 [Shared] Add fiscal-year backfill workflow to ingestion pipeline, reprocessing targeted partitions, regenerating applicability assessments, and recording correction windows in refresh logs (`artifacts/backfill_runs.json`).
- [X] T024 [Shared] Implement delayed-feed queue handling that stores pending agency files, deduplicates by (`award_id`, `agency`), and emits reconciliation reports/alerts for late arrivals under `artifacts/delayed_feed_reports/`.
- [X] T025 [Shared] Extend refresh command with archive retry + cache fallback (24-hour window) and flag incomplete runs via operator alerts and `artifacts/archive_retry_logs.json` when SBIR.gov archives remain unavailable.
- [X] T026 [Shared] Support incremental vs. full refresh modes in CLI/API (guarding partition updates), persist mode selection plus scope metadata in refresh manifests, and record operator rationale in `artifacts/refresh_mode_audit.json`.
- [X] T027 [Shared] Instrument refresh runs to capture start/end timestamps, wall-clock duration, malformed-record ratio, and completeness metrics, persisting the report to `artifacts/refresh_runs.json` for SC-006/NFR-003.
- [X] T028 [Shared] Implement bootstrap CSV loader (`src/sbir_cet_classifier/data/bootstrap.py`) that accepts `awards-data.csv`, validates schema compatibility with SBIR.gov format, maps columns to canonical ingestion schema, logs field mappings, and aborts if required fields (`award_id`, `agency`, `abstract`, `award_amount`) are absent; mark ingestion source as `bootstrap_csv` in metadata.
- [X] T029 [P][Shared] Build Grants.gov API client (`src/sbir_cet_classifier/data/external/grants_gov.py`) supporting solicitation lookup by topic code/solicitation number, returning description and technical topic keywords, with error handling for 404s and timeouts; include unit tests with mocked responses.
- [X] T030 [P][Shared] Build NIH API client (`src/sbir_cet_classifier/data/external/nih.py`) supporting solicitation lookup by agency-specific identifiers, returning description and technical topic keywords, with error handling for API unavailability; include unit tests.
- [X] T031 [P][Shared] ~~Build NSF API client~~ **REMOVED** - NSF API provides less data than CSV (only 118 char titles vs 1,871 char abstracts in CSV). CSV data is superior; fallback enrichment with NSF topic codes provides better coverage.
- [X] T032 [Shared] Implement SQLite solicitation cache (`src/sbir_cet_classifier/data/solicitation_cache.py`) at `artifacts/solicitation_cache.db` keyed by (API source, solicitation identifier) with indexed lookups, supporting permanent storage unless explicitly invalidated via operator command, and selective purging by API source, solicitation ID, or date range via SQL DELETE operations.
- [X] T033 [Shared] Build lazy enrichment orchestrator (`src/sbir_cet_classifier/features/enrichment.py`) that triggers on-demand when awards are first accessed for classification/viewing/export, checks SQLite cache before querying APIs, handles missing/unmatched solicitations gracefully by logging gaps and proceeding with award-only classification, marks failures as `enrichment_failed`, and versions solicitation text with source API and retrieval timestamp.
- [X] T034 [Shared] Implement batch enrichment optimization for export operations (`src/sbir_cet_classifier/features/batch_enrichment.py`) that identifies unique (API source, solicitation ID) tuples in export batches, checks cache, fetches missing solicitations concurrently (respecting API limits), and updates all awards sharing same solicitation atomically to prevent redundant fetches.
- [X] T035 [P][Shared] Add enrichment telemetry module (`src/sbir_cet_classifier/models/enrichment_metrics.py`) logging cache hit rates per API source, tracking enrichment latency distributions for live API calls (p50/p95/p99), and exposing metrics in `artifacts/enrichment_runs.json` for observability per NFR-008.
- [X] T036 [Shared] Integrate solicitation enrichment into classification pipeline (`src/sbir_cet_classifier/models/applicability.py`) so TF-IDF features include solicitation text (description + technical topic keywords) when available, with fallback to award-only features when enrichment fails or solicitation is missing.

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready‚Äîservices, CLI, API skeletons, and enrichment pipeline operational with tests.
