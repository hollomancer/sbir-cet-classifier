### 2025-10-10 - Data Quality Optimization Checklists

**Archived Files:**
- `data-quality-optimization.md` (103 items)
- `data-quality-optimization-RESULTS.md` (execution report)

**Reason for Archive:**
These checklists were created to validate requirements for implementing BENCHMARK_REPORT.md recommendations #2-8. After execution and analysis, the key findings were:
- 67 gaps (65%) identified in requirements completeness
- 36 requirements (35%) already met
- Critical recommendations were incorporated into the spec via clarification session 2025-10-10

**Actions Taken:**
1. **Spec Updates (Session 2025-10-10):** Added five clarifications addressing:
   - Batch validation with per-record error reporting (FR-001, Edge Cases)
   - Agency name-to-code mapping with "UNKNOWN" fallback (FR-001, Edge Cases)
   - Adaptive concurrency strategy for parallel processing (NFR-003, Edge Cases)
   - Liberal date parsing with dateutil parser (FR-001)
   - Validation error report format with standard fields (NFR-006)

2. **Release Readiness Updates:** The canonical `release-readiness.md` checklist was updated to reflect completed items, particularly:
   - CHK013-CHK015: Solicitation enrichment requirements ✅
   - CHK016-CHK018: Manual review & governance requirements ✅
   - CHK019-CHK024: Analyst interfaces, exports, and access control ✅

3. **Remaining Work:** Items from data-quality-optimization that are NOT yet in release-readiness.md (performance optimization specifics, observability metrics) remain as open items CHK025-CHK060 in the release-readiness checklist.

**Outcome:**
The data quality optimization requirements analysis successfully identified gaps and drove spec improvements. The findings are preserved in these archived files for historical reference, while the canonical release-readiness checklist continues to track all remaining items.
